  Hi, I am a full-stack developer currently studying software engineering in Czechia. I began coding since 2017, and I'm very passionate about it. Maintaining focus on web development right now. I enjoy organizing and cleaning stuff, fitness, learning stuff, working on cars. I find coding to be a creative, challenging, and rewarding pursuit.
